# SnakTheSnake
 This is a small Game called "Snak The Snake" and it exists because I wanted to start learning the library tkinter.

The main part of this program (The Game) is not mine. I found a build of it online and used it as a skeleton. This is because I had no idea, at the time, how to your this library so I needed a head start, and reading about how it works is... BORING! Seeing and writing it down helps me learn more easily, even if it is not mine.
To the original, I have added:

1. A Main Menu with a start, exit, and options button;
2. A Options menu:
3. Custam made Icons and buttons for the menu (exept for the Start, Options, and Exit buttons)
4. The ability to change the game's size and speed; (From the button options in the main menu);
5. An option to activate an additional gameplay feature called Bad Food (From the button options in the main menu) (More information about it below ðŸ‘‡);
6. Organisation of the functions and variables for ease of reading;
7. Adding a small explanation to the function and classes for ease of understanding.

BAD FOOD:
If active, this makes the food go bad after a set amount of turns. If eaten in this state, it counts as a game over. After a bit more time the rotten food will completely decompose and be replaced by another piece of food on the map. And repeat.

The Game's original code I used comes from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-game-using-tkinter-python/.


This was a good learning experience for me. Not sure if I will work on this in the future, but it was Fun!
